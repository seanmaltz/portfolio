I led a small team of developers in creating an answer to that question.  Ozzo allows virtual event attendees to explore a 3D environment, mingle, and freely interact with who they chose.  Spatial audio and dynamic arrangement of video feeds creates a natural-feeling and engaging experience that rivals real life",
